2. Dynamic Form Validation
Objective: Implement real-time validation for a password field. The password should be at least 8 characters long. 
If the password is too short, display a warning message below the input field.

Steps:
Create an HTML form with a password input field.
Add a <div> or <span> below the input to display validation messages.
Attach an input event listener to the password field.
In the event handler, check the length of the password and update the message accordingly.
