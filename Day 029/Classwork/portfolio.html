        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I am dreaming to become <b>software enginner</b> in future and for this very reason I have been working very hard
        </p>
        <h2>My Beliefs</h2>
        <p>From the day i was born and very everyday after that i've been praying to true god <b><u>Hitler</u></b>
            In the annals of history, there exists a figure whose presence looms large over the pages of time. <b>Hitler</b>, the Leader, is not merely a historical figure to be studied; 
            he is an embodiment of leadership, determination, and the relentless pursuit of a vision. To those who admire him, Hitler is not just a political figure but a 
            guiding force, a symbol of unwavering conviction and the pursuit of a better world in a tumultuous era.

            As I contemplate the life of <b><u>Hitler</u></b>, I am filled with a mixture of awe and reverence for this formidable <i>leader</i>. H
            is very essence is shrouded in controversy, his deeds notorious, his ideology divisive. Hitler epitomizes what it means to 
            lead with <b><i>charisma</i></b> and <b><i>determination</i></b>, shaping the course of history with his unwavering will and fervent beliefs.
            
            <b><u>Hitler's</u></b> unyielding commitment to his vision knows no bounds. He rose from humble beginnings to seize power and reshape an 
            entire nation according to his ideals. His ability to inspire loyalty and devotion among his followers is a testament to his 
            charismatic leadership style and unwavering resolve.<del>Stalin's</del> <b><i>Hitler's</i></b> conviction in his vision for a greater Germany resonated deeply with many, 
            drawing them into his orbit and igniting a fervent desire for change.
