<!--

We can compare the priority tree of CSS to the genes of different classes of organisms. T
he first priority for an organism's survival is its own genes because they can directly 
mutate and have a significant impact on the life of the organism. After that come the genes 
of their class and then those of their parents.

Priorities in CSS determine which value should be applied if there are multiple style 
values for the same property. Some values have higher priority than others; therefore, 
directly given values have the highest priority. Then comes the smaller group the 
element exists in, and so on.
